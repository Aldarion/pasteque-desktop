This installer is made with the version 5 of IzPack (http://izpack.org/).


HOW IT WORKS

Download IzPack and unpack it where you want.
Then you have to specified the IzPack's path in the build.xml file of Pasteque.

Default config assumes that you have unpack it in your home's folder.
Once unpacked and the path to its folder written, you juste have to call
"ant installer" in the base directory of Pasteque.
