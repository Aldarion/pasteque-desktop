Plonk is a stand-alone service to check registration validity.

== Installation ==

Make plonk.php accessible from your web server. You must have configured
POS-Tech web on the parent directory (in config.php, see main README). Then
configure the Plonk service by copying the plonk_conf.php.sample file to
plonk-conf.php. Edit the desired values.

== Usage ==

Point plonk.php on your web browser and scan the barcode of your customer card.

If it's valid, it will "plonk". If it's not valid it will "Replonk".
